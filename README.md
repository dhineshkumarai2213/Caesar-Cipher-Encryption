## 🧠 About the Project

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques in cryptography. This Python script allows users to encrypt or decrypt a message by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specific number of positions (known as the *key* or *shift value*).

This project was created for educational purposes and as a demonstration of classical encryption using Python.

## 🔎 Caesar Cipher: The Concept

- Each letter in the input text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
- For example, with a shift of 3:
  - `A` → `D`
  - `B` → `E`
  - `Z` → `C` (wrap-around using modular arithmetic)
- Non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are left unchanged.

---

## ✨ Features

- Encrypt or decrypt a message using Caesar Cipher
- User-defined shift value (positive or negative)
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores and preserves non-alphabetic characters (numbers, punctuation, etc.)
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Clear and interactive user experience

## 🧪 Demo

```bash
=== Caesar Cipher Encryption ===
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? e
Enter the text: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value (integer): 3
Encrypted Text: Khoor, Zruog!
```

```bash
=== Caesar Cipher Encryption ===
Do you want to (E)ncrypt or (D)ecrypt? d
Enter the text: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value (integer): 3
Decrypted Text: Hello, World!
```
